The set of all invertible elements in $\\mathbb Z/n$ is denoted as ${\\mathbb Z/n}^\\times$. Notice that $1\\in {\\mathbb Z/n}^\\times$ and for any two elements $x, y$ in this set, their product $xy$ is in the set as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only finitely many elements in this set, and so for some $k \\in \\mathbb N$, $a^k \\equiv 1 \\mod n$. There is a smallest such number, and so we can assume that it is $k$.\n",

    "Now, for $x, y \\in {\\mathbb Z/n}^\\times$, either $xA \\cap yA = \\emptyset$ or $xA\\cap yA \\neq \\emptyset$. If the latter holds, for some $g$, we have $g \\equiv xa^m \\equiv ya^l \\mod n$, and so $x \\equiv ya^{l-m} \\mod n$, meaning $xA \\subset yA$, and also $y \\equiv xa^{m-l} \\mod n$, meaning $yA \\subset xA$, and so the only two choices for elements $x, y$ is either $xA \\cap yA = \\emptyset$ or $xA = yA$. Then, the sets $xA$ partition ${\\mathbb Z/n}^\\times$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for each $xA$, notice that it has exactly $k$ elements: $x1, xa, \\dots, xa^{k-1}$, for if there were any fewer, it implies $xa^m \\equiv xa^l$ for distinct $0 < m \\neq l < k$ and $a^{m-l} \\equiv 1 \\mod n$, which contradicts that $k$ is the smallest such number.\n",

    "Thus, ${\\mathbb Z/n}^\\times$ consists of sets $xA$, each of which has $k$ elements, i.e. $k \\mid \\varphi(n)$, i.e. $\\varphi(n) = kM$ for some $M$ and so\n",
